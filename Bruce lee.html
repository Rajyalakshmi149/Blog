    <h2>Childehood</h2>
    <img src="./Bruce_Lee_with_his_parents_1940s.jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
    <p>Bruce Lee's birth name was Lee Jun-fan.
His father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera singer based in Hong Kong.
His mother Grace Ho was born in Shanghai. In December 1939, his parents traveled to California for an international opera tour in Chinatown, San Francisco.
Bruce was born there on November 27, 1940.His birth in the U.S. allowed him to claim U.S. citizenship due to the United States' jus soli citizenship laws.
When he was four months old (April 1941), the Lee family returned to Hong Kong.Soon after, the Lee family experienced unexpected hardships as Japan, amid World War II, 
launched a surprise attack on Hong Kong in December 1941 and ruled the city for the next four years.</p>
<p>
    The ethnicity of Bruce Lee's mother, Grace Ho, is contested.
    The traditional opinion is that Grace Ho's father was a German immigrant, and that her mother was Chinese,
    as attested by biographers Robert Clouse and Bruce Thomas. Bruce Lee's wife, Linda Lee Cadwell,
    wrote that Bruce Lee's grandfather was a German Catholic.
</p>
<p>A new alternative theory argues that Grace Ho's father was actually the son of a Dutch Jew, Charles Maurice Bosman, and his Chinese concubine.
    Charles Russo has questioned this origin story entirely, suggesting that Grace Ho's father might have been Chinese or mixed-Chinese,
    and that her mother might have been English. Matthew Polly concedes that Grace Ho's paternal grandfather was a Dutch Jew,
    but likewise asserts that her mother was English.</p>
<p>However, according to Doug Palmer, the claim that Grace Ho had an English mother is only speculation.
    Palmer also notes that family records suggest that the Dutch-Jewish Bosman family had originated from Germany,
    which may account for the assumption that Grace Ho was part German.<hr/>
<h2>Education</h2>
<h4>1940–1958: Early roles, schooling and martial arts initiation</h4>
<p>Lee's father was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child.
    Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl. He took his Chinese stage name as 李小龍, lit.
    "Lee the Little Dragon", for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon by the Chinese zodiac.</p>    
</p>
<p>
    At age seven, Lee began practicing tai chi together with his father.
    As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in The Kid in 1950, which was based on a comic book character, "Kid Cheung", and was his first leading role.
    By the time he was 18, he had appeared in 20 films.[33] After attending Tak Sun School (德信學校; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), 
    Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12.
</p>
<img src="./The_age_of_18_Bruce_Lee_and_Ye_Wen.jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<p>
    In the early 1950s, Lee's father became an opium addict. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (and possibly poor conduct), 
    Lee was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College.
    He was mentored by Brother Edward Muss, F.M.S., a Bavarian-born teacher and coach of the school boxing team.
</p>
<p>
    In 1953, Lee's friend William Cheung introduced him to Ip Man.
    According to Cheung, Lee's European background on his mother's side led him to be rejected, initially, 
    from learning Wing Chun kung fu under Ip Man because of the long-standing rule in the Chinese martial arts world not to teach foreigners.
    Cheung spoke on his behalf and Lee was accepted into the school and began training in Wing Chun with Ip Man.
    Ip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.
</p>
<p>
    After a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other students refused to train with Lee.
    They had learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians.
    Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, "Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man. 
    However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man, William Cheung, and Wong Shun-leung.
</p>
<p>
    In 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion, Gary Elms, in the final.
    That year, Lee who was also a good cha-cha dancer, won Hong Kong's Crown Colony Cha-Cha Championship.
</p><hr/>
<h2>Career</h2>
<h4>1959–1964: Move to Seattle</h4>
<p>
    In his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family.
    In 1958, after students from a rival Choy Li Fut martial arts school challenged Lee's Wing Chun school, he engaged in a fight on a rooftop.
    In response to an unfair punch by another boy, he beat him so badly that one of his teeth was knocked out, leading to the boy's parents making a complaint to the police.
</p>
<p>
    In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), 
    who was already living with family friends in San Francisco. After several months, he moved to Seattle in 1959 to continue his high school education,
    where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at her restaurant. Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. 
    Lee's elder brother Peter Lee (李忠琛) joined him in Seattle for a short stay, before moving on to Minnesota to attend college.
</p>
<p>
    In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the University of Washington. Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated,
    Lee's official major was drama rather than philosophy, according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni publication.
    In his junior year, he took two classes in psychology and two classes in philosophy; both of these became core interests for him for the rest of his life.
    He socialized with wealthy young people, but lived in relative poverty and worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant.
</p>
<h4>1964–1965: Oakland</h4>
<p>
    Lee dropped out of university in early 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee.
    James Lee was twenty years senior to Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland.
    James Lee was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, an American martial artist. At the invitation of Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships.
    He performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups, using the thumb and the index finger of one hand, with feet at approximately shoulder-width apart.
</p>
<p>
    Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.
    Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, Lee aggressively attacked him with the intent to kill. When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, 
    but instead, Lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong asserted that he refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence, 
    but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves. According to Michael Dorgan's 1980 book Bruce Lee's Toughest Fight, the fight ended due to Lee's "unusually winded" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.
</p>
<p>
    Lee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favor of pursuing martial arts. However, 
    a martial arts exhibition in Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by television producer William Dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for "Number One Son" about Lee Chan,
    the son of Charlie Chan. The show never materialized, but Dozier saw potential in Lee.
</p>
<h4>1966–1970: American roles and creating Jeet Kune Do</h4>
<p>
    From 1966 to 1967, Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier.
    titled The Green Hornet, based on the radio show by the same name.
    The show ran for one season (26 episodes) from September 1966 to March 1967.
    Lee and Williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of Batman, another William Dozier-produced television series.
</p>
<img src="./Van_Williams_and_Bruce_Lee_in_The_Green_Hornet_1966.jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<p>
After filming one season of The Green Hornet, Lee found himself out of work and opened the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Chinatown, Los Angeles.
The controversial match with Wong Jack-man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques.
He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting.
Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on "practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency". He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, 
and many others, which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.
</p>
<p>
    Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. The name means "way of the intercepting fist" in Cantonese.
    This was a new hybrid system that took footwork from boxing, kicks from kung fu, and technique from fencing.
    Lee emphasized what he called "the style of no style". This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach that Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles.
    Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist.
    It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.
</p>
<h4>1971–1973: Hong Kong films, stardom, and Hollywood breakthrough</h4>
<img src="./Bruce_Lee_1973.jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<img src="./images (2).jpg" alt="photo" width="20%"/>
<p>
    In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet, written by Silliphant. Lee played Li Tsung, the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet,
    played by James Franciscus, and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script.
    According to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee's death, Lee pitched a television series of his own in 1971, tentatively titled The Warrior, discussions of which were confirmed by Warner Bros. 
    During a December 9, 1971, television interview on The Pierre Berton Show, Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Bros. wanted him "to be in a modernized type of a thing and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western".
</p>
<p>
    According to Cadwell, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed Kung Fu, but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit Warner Bros.
    states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept,created by two writers and producers,
    Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander in 1969, as stated also by Lee's biographer Matthew Polly.According to these sources,
    the reason Lee was not cast was because he had a thick accent, but Fred Weintraub attributes that to his ethnicity.
    The role of the Shaolin monk in Kung Fu was eventually awarded to then-non-martial artist David Carradine. In an interview with The Pierre Berton Show, Lee stated he understood Warner Bros.'
    attitudes towards casting in the series: "They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong,
    and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there".

<p>
Lee played his first leading role in The Big Boss (1971), which proved to be an enormous box-office success across Asia and catapulted him to instant stardom in Hong Kong.
He followed up with Fist of Fury (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by The Big Boss, with film critic Blake Howard writing that Lee was "cresting the wave of international super-stardom".
Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, Concord Production Inc., with Chow. For his third film, The Way of the Dragon (1972), 
he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in Long Beach, California,
Lee met karate champion Chuck Norris. In The Way of the Dragon Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent. Their showdown has been characterized as "one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history. 
Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon grossed an estimated US$100 million and US$130 million worldwide, respectively.
From August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest film, Game of Death. He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with 7 ft 2 in (218 cm) American basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Bros. offered Lee the opportunity to star in Enter the Dragon, the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, and Warner Bros. 
Filming began in Hong Kong in February 1973 and was completed in April 1973.
</p>
<p>
    One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, 
    promoted Lee as a leading actor in Fist of Unicorn, although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favor to his long-time friend Unicorn Chan.
    Lee planned to sue the production company but retained his friendship with Chan.However, only a few months after the completion of Enter the Dragon,
    and six days before its July 26, 1973, release, Lee died.
    Enter the Dragon went on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films and cemented Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973,
    the equivalent of $4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007.Enter the Dragon is estimated to have grossed over $400 million worldwide,
    the equivalent of over $2 billion adjusted for inflation as of 2022.The tv show Kung Fu starring David Carradine first debuted in February 1972, reaching #1 by mid-1973 further contributing to a fad in martial arts. 
    The song "Kung Fu Fighting" and Marvel's Master of Kung Fu comic book came out in 1974.

<h2>Martial arts and fitness</h2>
<p>
    Lee's films are known for popularising the side kick, roundhouse kick, grappling, spinning heel kick, armbar, weapons such as the nunchaku, and his distinctive kiai. Lee was also known for popularising the one-inch punch and the two-finger push-up.
</p>
<img src="./images (4).jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<h4>Striking</h4>
<p>
    Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style tai chi.In his teens, Lee became involved in Hong Kong gang conflicts, which led to frequent street fights. The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun. Lee was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Ip Man, between late 1956 and 1957, after losing to rival gang members.
Ip's regular classes generally consisted of form practice, chi sao (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free sparring. There was no set pattern for the classes. Other Chinese martial arts styles Lee trained in were Northern Praying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Eagle Claw, Tan Tui, Law Hon, Mizongyi, Wa K'ung, Monkey, Southern Dragon, Fujian White Crane, Choy Li Fut, Hung Gar, Choy Gar, Fut Gar, Mok Gar, Yau Kung Moon, Li Gar, and Lau Gar.[need quotation to verify][page needed] Martial arts expert Donn F. Draeger regarded Lee as worthy of a Kyokushin 6th dan by the standards of the 1970s.
</p>
<h4>Grappling</h4>
<p>
    Lee favored cross-training between different fighting styles, and had a particular interest in grappling. Lee trained with several judo practitioners in Seattle and California, among them Fred Sato, Jesse Glover, Taky Kimura, Hayward Nishioka, and Wally Jay, as well as Gene LeBell. Many of his first students were proficient in judo and other arts, and he learned as much as he taught. After befriending LeBell on the set of The Green Hornet, Lee offered to teach him striking arts in exchange for being taught grappling techniques. LeBell had been taught catch wrestling by prestigious grapplers Lou Thesz and Ed Lewis, and notable techniques of both judo and catch wrestling can be seen in Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do. He also learned grappling moves from hapkido master Ji Han-jae.
According to Glover, Lee only found judo ineffective in the action of getting hold of the opponent. In their first training together, Glover showed Lee an osoto gari, which Lee considered not a bad technique, but he disliked that Glover had needed to hold onto Lee. While in Seattle, Lee developed anti-grappling techniques against opponents trying to tackle him or take him to the ground. Glover recalled that Lee "definitely would not go to the ground if he had the opportunity to get you standing up". Nonetheless, Lee expressed to LeBell a wish to integrate judo into his fighting style. He incorporated the osoto gari into Jeet Kune Do, among other throws, armlocks and chokeholds from judo.
</p>
<h4>Street Fighting</h4>
<img src="./images (3).jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<p>
    Another major influence on Lee was Hong Kong's street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights. In the mid-20th century, soaring crime in Hong Kong, combined with limited Hong Kong Police manpower, led to many young Hongkongers learning martial arts for self-defense. Around the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong, teaching their distinctive styles of martial arts. In Hong Kong's street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the 1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong's rooftops, to avoid crackdowns by British colonial authorities. Lee frequently participated in these Hong Kong rooftop fights. He combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts style.
When Lee returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s, his reputation as "the fastest fist in the east" routinely led to locals challenging him to street fights. He sometimes accepted these challenges and engaged in street fights, which led to some criticism from the press portraying him as violent at the time.
</p>
<h4>Fitness</h4>
<p>
    At 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) and weighing 64 kg (141 lb), Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with Wong Jack-man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, concerning balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In Tao of Jeet Kune Do he wrote:
Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation. ... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique
</p><hr/>
<h2>Artistry</h2>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>
    While best known as a martial artist, Lee studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy, starting while a student at the University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts.His books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to say that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings.
</p>
<p>
    He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge. He said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include Taoism and Buddhism. Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an atheist. When asked in about his religious affiliation, he replied, "None whatsoever". When asked if he believed in God, he said, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not."
In his notebooks, Lee cited and commented on passages from Plato, David Hume, René Descartes, and Thomas Aquinas, from Western philosophy, and Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, Miyamoto Musashi, and Alan Watts from Eastern thought. He was particularly interested in the Indian mystic Jiddu Krishnamurti
</p>
<h4>Poetry</h4>
<p>
    Aside from martial arts and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles, Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotions and a stage in his life collectively. Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist."
His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husband's notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned, "Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark—reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche".
Most of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as Robert Frost, one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The free verse form of Lee's poetry reflects his quote "Be formless ... shapeless, like water."
</p><hr/>
<h2>Personal life</h2>
<h4>Names</h4>
<p>
Lee's Cantonese birth name was Lee Jun-fan (李振藩). The name homophonically means "return again", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age. Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him Sai-fon (細鳳), which is a feminine name meaning "small phoenix". The English name "Bruce" is thought to have been given by the hospital's attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.
Lee had three other Chinese names: Lee Yuen-cham (李源鑫), a family/clan name; Lee Yuen-kam (李元鑒), which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College, and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung (李小龍; Siu-lung means "little dragon").[citation needed] Lee's given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as 震藩; however, the Jun (震) Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (李震彪).[citation needed] Hence, the Chinese character for Jun in Lee's name was changed to the homonym 振 instead, to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition.
</p>
<h4>Family</h4>
<p>
    Lee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.[citation needed]
Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.[citation needed]
Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown Colony.
</p>
<img src="./330px-Bruce_Lee_-_son.jpg" alt="photo" width="30%"/>
<p>
    In the 2018 biography Bruce Lee: A Life, Matthew Polly identifies Lee's maternal grandfather as Ho Kom-tong, who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather. Ho Kom-tong's father, Charles Maurice Bosman, was a Dutch Jewish businessman from Rotterdam. He moved to Hong Kong with the Dutch East India Company and served as the Dutch consul to Hong Kong at one time. He had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children, including Ho Kom Tong. Bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California. Ho Kom Tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife, 13 concubines, and a British mistress who gave birth to Grace Ho.
His younger brother Robert Lee Jun-fai is a musician and singer; he performed in the Hong Kong group The Thunderbirds. A few singles were sung mostly or all in English. Also released was Lee singing a duet with Irene Ryder. Lee Jun-fai lived with Lee in Los Angeles in the United States and stayed. After Lee's death, Lee Jun-fai released an album and a single by the same name dedicated to Lee called "The Ballad of Bruce Lee".
While studying at the University of Washington he met his future wife Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher. As relations between people of different races were still banned in many US states, they married in secret in August 1964. Lee had two children with Linda: Brandon (1965–1993) and Shannon Lee (born 1969). Upon's Lee passing in 1973, Linda continued to promote Bruce Lee's martial art Jeet Kune Do. She wrote the 1975 book Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew, on which the 1993 feature film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story was based. In 1989, she wrote the book The Bruce Lee Story. She retired in 2001 from the family estate
</p>
<h4>Friends, students, and contemporaries</h4>
<P>
    Lee's brother Robert with his friends Taky Kimura, Dan Inosanto, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Peter Chin were his pallbearers. Coburn was a martial arts student and a friend of Lee. Coburn worked with Lee and Stirling Silliphant on developing The Silent Flute. Upon Lee's early death, at his funeral, Coburn gave a eulogy. Regarding McQueen, Lee made no secret that he wanted everything McQueen had and would stop at nothing to get it.Inosanto and Kimura were friends and disciples of Lee. Inosanto would go on to train Lee's son Brandon. Kimura continued to teach Lee's craft in Seattle. According to Lee's wife, Chin was a lifelong family friend and a student of Lee.
James Yimm Lee (no relation) was one of Lee's three personally certified 3rd rank instructors and co-founded the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Oakland where he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu in Lee's absence. James was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, the organizer of the Long Beach International Karate Championships, where Lee was first introduced to the martial arts community. Hollywood couple Roman Polański and Sharon Tate studied martial arts with Lee. Polański flew Lee to Switzerland to train with him. Tate studied with Lee in preparation for her role in The Wrecking Crew. After Tate was murdered by the Manson Family, Polański initially suspected Lee.
</P>
<P>
    Basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar studied martial arts and developed a friendship with Lee.[107] Actor and karate champion Chuck Norris was a friend and training partner of Lee's. After Lee's death, Norris said he kept in touch with Lee's family. Judoka and professional wrestler Gene LeBell became a friend of Lee on the set of The Green Hornet. They trained together and exchanged their knowledge of martial arts.
Taiwanese actress Betty Ting immediately came under media's spotlight after it was revealed that Bruce Lee was found unconscious at her flat before his death. At her testimony Ting said she was asked by producer Raymond Chow, who in turn was told by Lee's family, not to disclose that Lee was at her apartment, which contributed to the misinformation that Lee died at his own house. Ting later said that Lee fell in love with her and the two shared a close relation. Her constant presence by Lee's side earned her the affectionate nickname of "Little Dragon Girl" (or Bruce's Girl).
</P>
<h4>Drug use</h4>
<p>
    In July 2021 a private collection of over 40 handwritten letters Lee made to fellow Fist of Fury actor Robert "Bob" Baker was sold for $462,500 at Heritage Auctions. These letters were written from 1967 to 1973 and included requests by Lee for Baker to mail him cocaine, pain killers, psilocybin and other drugs for his personal use. Doctor Poon Wai-ming in Hong Kong said cocaine could have caused his collapse in May 1973, two months before his death.
</p><hr/>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>
On May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an automated dialogue replacement session for Enter the Dragon at Orange Sky Golden Harvest Film Studio in Hong Kong. Because he was having epileptic seizures and headaches, he was rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital, where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema. He had a high fever and was completely unconscious without any signs of breathing. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol. A brain scan in the United States after this diagnosed Bruce Lee with convulsive disorder.

    On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong planning to have dinner with actor George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda and testimony at Lee's coroner's court, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film Game of Death. They worked until 4 p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague Betty Ting arriving at around 5. The three then went over the script at Ting's home. At around 7 Lee, having a headache, took a painkiller from Ting and took a nap. Chow left around an hour later to attend a dinner meeting with Lazenby, which Lee was expected to join later.[233][234][230]
When Lee did not arrive at the dinner, Chow came to the apartment at around 9.45 p.m., but he was unable to wake Lee up. Chu Poh-hwye, a private doctor of Ting, was summoned at 10, as Lee's doctor was unreachable, and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee, who by then no longer had any vital signs, before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lee was declared dead on arrival at the age of 32.
Lee was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. Pallbearers at Lee's funeral on July 25, 1973, included Taky Kimura, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Dan Inosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee's brother Robert.
